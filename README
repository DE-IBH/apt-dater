README for apt-dater
====================

apt-dater provides an ncurses frontend for managing package updates on a large
number of remote hosts using SSH. It supports Debian-based managed hosts as
well as rug (e.g. openSUSE) and yum (e.g. CentOS) based systems.

Prepare the managed hosts by apt-dater:

 You need a SSH server and sudo installed. Create a user which will be used to
 install updates (using root is NOT recommended).

 Debian based system

  Modify the /etc/sudoers:

   the-user ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/bin/aptitude

  Copy the PERL script apt-dater-host from the $SRC/clients/debian directory to
  a path on the managed host which are listed in the $PATH variable.

 yum based system (e.g. CentOS,...)

  Modify the /etc/sudoers:

   the-user ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/yum

  Copy the PERL script apt-dater-host from the $SRC/clients/yum directory to
  a path on the managed host which are listed in the $PATH variable.

 rug based system (e.g. openSUSE,...)

  Modify the /etc/sudoers:

   the-user ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rug

  Copy the PERL script apt-dater-host from the $SRC/clients/rug directory to a
  path on the managed host which are listed in the $PATH variable.

Management server:

 Beginning with version 0.5.5 the initial configuration files will be
 automatically created after the first startup of apt-dater.
 You just have to modify the file $HOME/.config/apt-dater/apt-dater.conf and
 the $HOME/.config/apt-dater/hosts.conf.

 Create a user on your management server which perform updates on your Debian
 hosts.

 Generate a SSH keypair:

  ssh-keygen -t TYPE

 Distribute the public key(s) e.g.:

  ssh-copy-id .ssh/your-public-key managed-host
