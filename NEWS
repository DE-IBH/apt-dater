Changes in 1.0.0
================

The config file backend has been switched from glib's keyfile to
libconfig. The filenames have been changed:

    apt-dater.conf => apt-dater.config
    hosts.conf     => hosts.config

Manual convertion to the new format is required! apt-dater creates some
default config files if a file does not exist.
