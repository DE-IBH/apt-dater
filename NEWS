Changes in 1.0.2
================

The config file backend has been switched from glib's keyfile to
libxml2. The filenames have changed:

    apt-dater.conf => apt-dater.xml
    hosts.conf     => hosts.xml

apt-dater uses a external perl script to convert the legacy hosts.conf
file. Manual convertion of apt-dater.conf is required! apt-dater creates
some default config files if a file does not exist during startup.
