apt-dater-host
==============

This directory contains the client perl scripts providing a generic
package management interface for several GNU/Linux distributions.

Hosts managed by apt-dater musst have the apt-dater-host command in
the search path.


Calling syntax
==============

An apt-dater-host script must accept the following command parameters:


refresh
-------

Updates the package list (i.e. apt-get update) and retrieve status
informations (see next command). This command is called none user
interactive.


status
------

Prints status informations about installed distribution and packages.
This command is non user interactive.

There should be an LSB release line of the format:

    LSBREL: ${Distri}|{Version}|${Codename}

Example for Debian Etch:

    LSBREL: Debian|4.0|etch

For each installed package there must be a status line:

    STATUS: ${Package}|${InstVersion}|${Status}...

    Supported status values:
	i		: installed
	h		: hold back
	u=${NewVersion}	: update available
	x		: extra (no version found in any repository, this
			  might be an obsoleted package)

Example for an installed package:

    STATUS: g++-4.1|4.1.1-21|i

Example for an installed package with an update available:

    STATUS: dnsutils|1:9.3.4-2etch1|u=1:9.3.4-2etch3

There should be a kernel info line (see also 'kernel' command).


upgrade
-------

Install all available upgrades, this is user interactive.


install
-------

Install package(s) given as parameters to this command. This command
is user interactive.


kernel
------

Retrieves informations about the running kernel. This command is non user
interactive.

The result line has the following format:

    KERNELINFO: ${Code} ${Release}

The following codes are supported:
    0 - The running kernel is the latest distri kernel. No reboot required.
    1 - The running kernel is an distri kernel but it's older then the latest
        installed. A reboot is recommended.
    2 - No distri kernel is running.
    9 - Unknown.

The release field should be the output of `uname -r`.

The following lines show an example output of the 'status' command for a
Debian Etch installation (the 'STATUS:' lines are truncated):
