apt-dater-host
==============

This directory contains the client perl scripts providing a generic
package management interface for several GNU/Linux distributions.

Hosts managed by apt-dater musst have the apt-dater-host command in
the search path.

User interactive commands (see below) will be shown to the user
unfiltered. Non-user interactive commands are parse by apt-dater.

Non-user interactive sessions should start with the protocol version:

    ADPROTO: ${ProtoVersion}

The current protocol version is 0.4. Example:

    ADPROTO: 0.4


Calling syntax
==============

An apt-dater-host script must accept the following command parameters:


refresh
-------

Updates the package list (i.e. apt-get update) and retrieve status
informations (see next command). This command is called none user
interactive.


status
------

Prints status informations about installed distribution and packages.
This command is non user interactive.

There should be an LSB release line of the format:

    LSBREL: ${Distri}|{Version}|${Codename}

Example for Debian Etch:

    LSBREL: Debian|4.0|etch


There sould be an VIRTualization line of the format:

    VIRT: ${Name}

This will only work if the remote host has the imvirt script
installed. Detected virtualizations:

  Microsoft Corporation / Virtual Machine:
    VIRT: Virtual Machine

  VMware, Inc. / VMware Virtual Platform:
    VIRT: VMware Virtual Platform

  QEMU or KVM:
    VIRT: QEMU

  Xen:
    VIRT: Xen

  non detected:
    VIRT: Physical

  imvirt not installed:
    VIRT: Unknown


There sould be an UNAME line of the format:

    UNAME: ${KERNEL-NAME}|${MACHINE}

The values are taken from the uname command:

    KERNEL-NAME: uname -s
    MACHINE    : uname -m


There might be a FORBID line of the format:

    FORBID: ${Operations}

This is a mask of forbidded apt-dater-host operations.
An single operation is represented by the following values:

    1:	refresh
    2:	upgrade
    4:	install

These values are binary ORed. Default value is 0 if no
there is no FORBID line (allows all operations).

The apt-dater-host executable on the client will refused
operations marked as forbidden.


There should be an UUID line:

UUID: {$UUID}

This is the DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996 and RFC 4122
compliant Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) of the host.
It should be a DCE version 1 (time and node based) UUID,
generated at the installation time of the apt-dater-host
client.


For each installed package there must be a status line:

    STATUS: ${Package}|${InstVersion}|${Status}...

    Supported status values:
	i		: installed
	h		: hold back
	u=${NewVersion}	: update available
	x		: extra (no version found in any repository, this
			  might be an obsoleted package)
	b=${AddInfo}	: package is installed but broken
			  (i.e. not configured)

Example for an installed package:

    STATUS: g++-4.1|4.1.1-21|i

Example for an installed package with an update available:

    STATUS: dnsutils|1:9.3.4-2etch1|u=1:9.3.4-2etch3

There should be a kernel info line (see also 'kernel' command).


upgrade
-------

Install all available upgrades, this is user interactive.


install
-------

Install package(s) given as parameters to this command. This command
is user interactive.


kernel
------

Retrieves informations about the running kernel. This command is non user
interactive.

The result line has the following format:

    KERNELINFO: ${Code} ${Release}

The following codes are supported:
    0 - The running kernel is the latest distri kernel. No reboot required.
    1 - The running kernel is an distri kernel but it's older then the latest
        installed. A reboot is recommended.
    2 - No distri kernel is running.
    9 - Unknown.

The release field should be the output of `uname -r`.


Example
=======

The following lines show an example output of the 'status' command for a
Debian Etch installation (the 'STATUS:' lines are truncated):

ADPROTO: 0.3
LSBREL: Debian|4.0|etch
